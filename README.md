Please create a database then upload websys_project.sql into phpmyadmin. Next edit the dbconnect.php file with the database name you created and your user and password for MySQL. Navigate to index.php and create and RA or RD account to create forms, then create an AD account to view the forms created by RAs and RDs. The student evaluation form does not require the user to be logged in to submit.

The use case diagram is included in the folder details operation flow.

Overall, this project went well. The team had a lot of synergy, and the problem was one that exists in Rensselaer's campus today.

In terms of what went right with the project, the actual code fulfilled the requirements of the project. Users can log in and create accounts depending on their role on staff. Three different kinds of accounts can be made: Resident Assistants (RAs), Resident Directors (RDs), and Assistant Deans (ADs). The RAs and RDs can submit programproposals while the ADs review them. The same can be done with program evaluation. The HTML and CSS is valid, and the PHP fulfills the functions it has to as it connects to a database with several different tables. The dashboard gets relevant user info from the users table and puts it on the page, and checks the forms table to see if the user has any forms due or has any forms to accept/reject. When a user submits the form, it is added to the forms table containing the data the user entered in that form. We use PHP to show users the forms they have submitted.

One scope change that had been established in the project was of the Google Calendar. The team did not have enoughtime to implement all the features which would have been nice-to-have for the project. A Google Calendar with ResLife events would have been nice-to-have, but the team could not establish it in the time avaliable.

If the team were to do the project again, the requirements would have been clearly defined from the beginning as stated during the presentation. The schedule would have also been followed in order to include nice-to-havefeatures. Authentication with the Rensselaer CAS system would have been integrated as well, in order to keep track of which students were making accounts.

All in all, the project was a success. It fulfilled everything it set out to do, and the team learned a lot during the process. Working with the team was great, and everyone were able to help each other when needed.

Thank you for the oppurtunity!
