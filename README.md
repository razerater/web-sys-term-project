This application allows reslife staff to submit and review forms. Accounts and form data are stored in a database. RA RD accounts can submit forms, and AD accounts can review as well as approved and deny those form on the dashboard. The user experience is designed to begin on index.php, but navigating to dashboard will bring the user to login.php if there is no active session.

Please create a database then upload websys_project.sql into phpmyadmin. Next edit the dbconnect.php file with the database name you created and your user and password for MySQL. Navigate to index.php and create and RA or RD account to create forms, then create an AD account to view the forms created by RAs and RDs. The student evaluation form does not require the user to be logged in to submit.
